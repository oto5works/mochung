    <p>Simple speak introduction for Terms of Service
You’re busy. We get it. So we’ve summed up our Terms of Service in a few simple sentences. They don’t replace the official legal stuff, but they will give you an idea of what’s in there. Any questions or concerns – please contact us.

Here are the headlines (imagine them with a clock bonging in the background if you like):

You have to be 16 years or older to use our tools.
Your content is yours – you own it, and you are responsible for it. We’ll only do what’s needed for our services to work properly...
...unless you are doing something illegal, in which case we can block and/or delete your stuff, and suspend your accounts.
We may make changes to our terms, service and/or fees from time to time. If you have an account and don’t like something we change, you can always cancel at any time.
And we should mention that you use our service at your own risk; we are not liable for any damages if things go wrong.
And that’s it. Seems fair right? You do you, we’ll do us and everything will be fine.

WeTransfer File Sharing

WeTransfer File Sharing allows you to share your Content with others.

To share your Content you need to upload it and provide us with (a limited number of) email addresses of recipient(s) (“email transfer”) or choose to distribute a download link yourself (“link transfer”). If you use link transfer you will not be informed of any downloads by others. WeTransfer reserves the right to limit downloads and/or attempted downloads by users for all File Sharing activity.  You warrant that you will not use email transfers to send spam or otherwise unsolicited, unlawful or unwanted Content to the recipients whose email addresses you provide to us.

WeTransfer File Sharing provides the possibility to upload and share Content up to a maximum total capacity. Uploaded Content is stored on WeTransfer’s servers for a limited period of time after which the ability to download expires. Depending on the transfer type and your subscription, limitations apply, which you can find here.

After the expiry period WeTransfer will permanently delete the uploaded files. These files will not be available nor retrievable anymore.

The basic functionality of WeTransfer File Sharing is (currently) free from registration and charge.

WeTransfer treats Content as confidential and does not control the use of download links, regardless of whether they are originally distributed by us or by you. Recipients can forward the links and allow others to use them. You are solely responsible for the Content you upload and share.

There are a number of paid subscription packages which - compared to the free version - offer you a set of additional services and different subscription terms. You can find more information here.

WeTransfer Premium offers you (amongst others) unlimited WeTransfer File Sharing storage. You will have 5 Terabyte of capacity at your disposal. Should you require more, then you can file a request at support@wetransfer.com.

WeTransfer reserves the right to permanently delete Content from your account (including from Portals and Reviews) when you stop interacting with WeTransfer for a period of at least 12 consecutive months, when you delete your Content from your account, when you cancel your WeTransfer subscription or when you delete your account. Full payment of applicable fees is considered to be active use of your account. For more information on WeTransfer’s data retention policy, please read our Privacy Policy.

WeTransfer Teams (“Teams”) allows you to add team members to your paid WeTransfer account. Team members can be easily added and removed per subscription period.

The start date of the Teams’ paid subscription period is when you have signed up as team owner (“Team Owner”) of the Teams account.

For Teams, additional payment and cancellation terms apply. These are listed in Clause 9.
