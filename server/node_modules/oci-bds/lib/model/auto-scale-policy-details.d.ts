You can create following types of autoscaling policies:

- **MetricBasedVerticalScalingPolicy:** Vertical autoscaling action is triggered when a performance metric exceeds a threshold
* - **MetricBasedHorizontalScalingPolicy:** Horizontal autoscaling action is triggered when a performance metric exceeds a threshold
* - **ScheduleBasedVerticalScalingPolicy:** Vertical autoscaling action is triggered at the specific times that you schedule.
* - **ScheduleBasedHorizontalScalingPolicy:** Horizontal autoscaling action is triggered at the specific times that you schedule.
