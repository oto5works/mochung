/**
 * The Delete Rows masking format deletes the rows that meet a user-specified
 * condition. It is useful in conditional masking when you want to delete a
 * subset of values in a column and mask the remaining values using some other
 * masking formats. You should be careful while using this masking format. If
 * no condition is specified, all rows in a table are deleted. If a column is
 * being masked using Delete Rows, there must not be a foreign key constraint
 * or dependent column referring to the table. To learn more, check Delete Rows
 * in the Data Safe documentation.
